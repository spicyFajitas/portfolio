Welcome to my documentation! I currently attend Michigan Technological University as a dedicated student in Computer Network and System Administration. I am looking to grow my education and career as a DevOps Engineer or Site Reliability Engineer. My primary education is in network engineering, Windows server environments, and virtualization, but my work experience has made me become interested in DevOps and other automation roles.

I started my journey in IT with three different IT Help Desk positions. I was the boots-on-the-ground person to do initial troubleshooting with any and all computer hardware and software issues. I have experiences in manufacturing and education environments.

After help desk, I joined a Cloud Team. I learned about deploying applications with a cloud-native mindset and also learned how cloud deployments can help businesses save money on environments while being able to dynamically scale according to their needs.

Next, I stepped into the automation space. I am learning a lot about CI/CD principles and the tools that help teams achieve their goals. I am constantly learning new technologies and problem solving, all of which is driven by my passion for IT.
