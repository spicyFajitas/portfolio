I currently attend Michigan Technological University as a dedicated student in Computer Network and System Administration. I am looking to grow my education and career as a DevOps Engineer or Site Reliability Engineer. My primary education is in network engineering, Windows server environments, and virtualization, but my work experience has made me become interested in DevOps and other automation roles.
I started my journey in IT with three different IT Help Desk positions.</description></item></channel></rss>
